# Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for 
# SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123).
# Warning: When changing the SSH port, make sure that the firewall is open for port 2200 first, 
# so that you don't lock yourself out of the server.When you change the SSH port, 
# the Lightsail instance will no longer be accessible through the web app 'Connect using SSH' button. 
# The button assumes the default port is being used. 
# There are instructions on the same page for connecting from your terminal to the instance. 
# Connect using those instructions and then follow the rest of the steps.
