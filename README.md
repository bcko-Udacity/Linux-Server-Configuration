## Summary of software installed and configuration changes made

### Update all currently installed packages
- One of the most important and simplest ways to ensure your system is secure is to keep your software up to date with new releases
- when setting up a new machine, you can be pretty safe in just accepting that the system is always making the best decisions for you
```bash
sudo apt update     # update available package lists
sudo apt upgrade    # upgrade installed packages
sudo apt autoremove # automatically remove packages that are no longer required
```

### Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config  # change port 22 to 2200
sudo service ssh restart        # restart ssh service
```

### Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123).
- Warning: When changing the SSH port, make sure that the firewall is open for port 2200 first, 
- so that you don't lock yourself out of the server.
- When you change the SSH port, the Lightsail instance will no longer be accessible through the web app 'Connect using SSH' button. The button assumes the default port is being used. 
```bash
sudo ufw status                 # check ufw status 
sudo ufw default deny incoming  # initially block all incoming requests
sudo ufw default allow outgoing # default rule for outgoing connections
sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp         # allow SSH on port 2200
sudo ufw allow www              # allow HTTP on port 80
sudo ufw allow ntp              # allow NTP on port 123
sudo ufw enable                 # enable firewall
sudo ufw status                 # check ufw status
```

### Create a New User `grader` and give `grader` access

```bash
sudo adduser grader # create a new user named grader
mkdir .ssh

# use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-quickstart
usermod -aG sudo grader
```

### Create an SSH key pair for grader using the ssh-keygen tool
```bash

```

### Prepare to deploy your project

### Deploy the Item Catalog project

```bash


# configure the Lightsail firewall to allow it

# Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for 
# SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123).
# Warning: When changing the SSH port, make sure that the firewall is open for port 2200 first, 
# so that you don't lock yourself out of the server.When you change the SSH port, 
# the Lightsail instance will no longer be accessible through the web app 'Connect using SSH' button. 
# The button assumes the default port is being used. 
# There are instructions on the same page for connecting from your terminal to the instance. 
# Connect using those instructions and then follow the rest of the steps.

# Create a new user account named grader.
sudo adduser grader

# Give grader the permission to sudo.

# Create an SSH key pair for grader using the ssh-keygen tool.


# Configure the local timezone to UTC.

# Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application

# Install the Python 3 mod_wsgi package on your server: 
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3.

# Install and configure PostgreSQL:

# Do not allow remote connections

# Create a new database user named catalog that has limited permissions 
# to your catalog application database.

# Install git
sudo apt install git

# Clone and setup your Item Catalog project from the Github repository 
# you created earlier in this Nanodegree program.

# Set it up in your server so that it functions correctly 
# when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. 
# Make sure that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!
