# Intro to Linux
Notes from Udacity Linux for Web Developers course

## Introduction
Welcome to Linux for Web Developers. I'm Mike Wills and I'll be your instructor for this course. Every time you visit a web application, your browser is requesting a number of files that are sitting on a server somewhere out there on the Internet.More often than not, that server is running Linux. Therefore, as you develop and get ready to launch your own web applications, it's critical that you understand how these servers work and how to get your web application up and running on one. In this course you'll do just that. You'll start with a quick introduction to Linux, and you begin exploring the Linux file system. How are files organized, where do they belong. I'll then introduce you to a number of Linux security concepts. Managing users, how to understand permission system, firewalls, and package or software management. 

Finally, you'll get a very basic web application up and running using the Apache web server, and a postscript SQL database server. Managing and configuring servers is one of my favorite parts of this career. There's something very powerful in
knowing that you've taken a server from zero to hero, all on your own and are in full control of it's capabilities. I think you'll enjoy this experience, and in the end, you'll be able to truly share your web applications with others while having the most intimate, low level knowledge of how people are actually receiving and experiencing your application.


## What is Linux
Linux is by far the most popular
operating system of choice for
web servers on the Internet today.
Some estimates say 80% of
public Internet servers
are running some flavor of Linux.
So what exactly is Linux?
Linux is an operating system
similar to Microsoft Windows or
Apple OS X,
which you might be more familiar with.
The biggest difference with
Linux though is it's free.
Now, when I say free,
you may be thinking of money, and
that's not necessarily the case.
You may have heard the phrases,
free as in beer and free as in speech.
It's quite popular within
the open source community.
Let's discuss what
each of these means and
how they apply to
the Linux operating system.

## Free as in Beer
Free as in beer refers to money.
If someone buys you a beer,
it costs you nothing.
Many versions of Linux are,
in fact, free for you to use.
But just because you get to use it for
free, doesn't mean you get to see
the underlying source code or
modify it for your own purposes.
Free as in speech refers to your
rights or liberties with the software.
You're free to run the software how
you like, see how the software works,
redistribute the software, and
improve upon or modify the software.
This latter definition, free as in
speech, is how Linux became so popular.
There are literally hundreds of versions
or distributions of Linux available.
And it's because of this
latter definition of freedom,
that this became possible.
So with all these different
versions of Linux available,
how do you pick the right one?

## Research Two Linux Distributions
With all of these distributions,
it's important for
you to learn how to do some basic
research on a distribution.
And compare them against one another.
Take a moment to research two
different Linux distributions.
And share what you've learned with
other students in the forums.
Here are some suggestions for
what you should look for.
Once you've shared your
research on the forums.
Take some time to read what your
fellow students have discovered
about the distributions they covered.
When all you're done,
